# NodeJS, Mongo, and Web Components - An Example

This repo is meant to serve as a very basic example for how to work with NodeJS+Express, MongoDB+Mongoose, and web components.

This repo was built for use by students in the UTD EPICS - I originally wrote it for the TexProtects teams but I figure it may be helpful to any team that is working on a project using these technologies. At some point in the future, I may do some repos like this in other languages. 

This is a simple todo app, with very little styling outside of layout, and no editing of todos - these are intended to be exercises for students if they want to explore and learn using this repo as a starting point.

Feel free to suggest improvements or make pull requests, but please keep in mind this meant for absolute beginners who may have a million other things that they need to be working on at the same time - anything that will result in greater complexity is automatically at a disadvantage when it comes to being considered for integration into this repo. That being said there is probably at least one stupid mistake in here that I haven't caught yet - if you see one let me know!
